# AGREEMENT REGARDING CODEBASE MODIFICATIONS

## ARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS

1.1 “Codebase” shall refer collectively to all source code, configuration files, scripts, templates, and ancillary resources encompassed within the software repository under version control.

1.2 “TODO Segments” shall mean those discrete portions of the Codebase expressly annotated with the token “TODO” (or any semantically equivalent annotation) and thereby designated as the sole loci for permissible modification.

1.3 “Contributor” shall denote any individual or entity granted access to the Codebase for the purpose of review, enhancement, or maintenance.

## ARTICLE II – SCOPE OF PERMITTED MODIFICATIONS

2.1 Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, Contributors are hereby expressly licensed and may, without further authorization, implement alterations, enhancements, or remediations exclusively within the boundaries of the TODO Segments.

2.2 All modifications effected pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be limited in scope to the functionality, logic, or commentary explicitly encompassed by each TODO Segment, and shall not extend to, alter, or otherwise impact any portion of the Codebase outside such segments.

## ARTICLE III – PROHIBITION OF UNAUTHORIZED ALTERATIONS

3.1 Contributors shall refrain from introducing, deleting, refactoring, reorganizing, or otherwise changing any portion of the Codebase that lies beyond the TODO Segments, save to the extent that such restriction is rendered impracticable by manifest error or critical security vulnerability, in which event the Contributor shall comply with the escalation procedures set forth in Section 3.2.

3.2 In the event that an exigent need arises to modify code outside the TODO Segments, the Contributor must (a) furnish a written justification detailing the nature and necessity of the proposed changes, (b) obtain prior written approval from the designated Codebase Custodian, and (c) document the approved changes in the project’s change log with explicit reference to the causal justification.

## ARTICLE IV – GENERAL PROVISIONS

4.1 Failure to comply with the constraints established in Articles II and III shall constitute a material breach of Contributor responsibilities and may, at the discretion of the Codebase Custodian, precipitate revocation of modification privileges and other remedial measures.

4.2 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the highest standards of software governance protocols, without regard to conflicts of law principles.

4.3 The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect its interpretation.
