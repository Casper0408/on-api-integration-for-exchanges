# COVENANT RELATING TO SOURCE CODE AMENDMENTS

## ARTICLE I — INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS

1.1 “Codebase” shall hereinafter signify the aggregate of all software artifacts, including, *inter alia*, source code files, configuration manifests, build scripts, documentation, metadata, and any derivative or ancillary materials now or hereafter maintained under version control.

1.2 “TODO Segments” shall hereinafter denote those narrowly circumscribed portions of the Codebase expressly demarcated by the literal inscription “TODO” (or any substantially equivalent notation) and designated as the sole permissible *loci* for Contributor-initiated modification.

1.3 “Contributor” shall hereinafter denote any natural person or juridical entity granted any form of access to the Codebase for purposes of inspection, enhancement, maintenance, refactoring, or correction.

1.4 “Custodian” shall hereinafter denote the individual or committee vested with ultimate oversight, governance authority, and stewardship of the Codebase.

## ARTICLE II — AUTHORIZATION OF MODIFICATIONS

2.1 Notwithstanding any contrary stipulation contained herein or implied at law or equity, Contributors are irrevocably empowered to effect amendments, enhancements, or remediations solely within the four corners of the TODO Segments, *mutatis mutandis*.

2.2 Each amendment pursuant to Section 2.1 shall remain strictly confined to the syntactic, semantic, and commentary content expressly encompassed by the TODO Segments and shall not, *ipso facto* or by implication, extend to, reorganize, refactor, or otherwise alter any portion of the Codebase beyond such Segments.

## ARTICLE III — PROHIBITION OF UNAUTHORIZED ALTERATIONS

3.1 Contributors shall abstain from introducing, deleting, renaming, reorganizing, refactoring, re-indentation, whitespace normalization, or any other alteration whatsoever to regions of the Codebase that lie outside the TODO Segments, save only where such proscription is rendered manifestly impracticable by clear error or exigent security exigency.

3.2 Should circumstances arise wherein modification of non-TODO Segments is deemed necessary or expedient, the Contributor is respectfully enjoined to:

  a.    Prepare a written exposition specifying with particularity the nature, scope, and criticality of the proposed out-of-bounds amendments;

  b.    Solicit and obtain the Custodian’s written concurrence prior to implementation; and

  c.    Enter a contemporaneous record of the approved deviation in the canonical change log, citing the factual justification and Custodian’s endorsement.

## ARTICLE IV — PRUDENTIAL COUNSEL AND COLLABORATIVE PRINCIPLES

4.1 Contributors are earnestly counselled to adhere unfailingly to the constraints articulated in Articles II and III, in order to preserve the integrity, coherence, and maintainability of the Codebase.

4.2 In the event that a Contributor departs from these admonitions without first securing the Custodian’s concurrence, it is suggested that the Contributor forthwith notify the Custodian, review the deviation collaboratively, and, to the fullest practicable extent, restore compliance at the earliest juncture.

4.3 Consistent observance of this Covenant fosters an environment of mutual trust and orderly governance; recurrent non-adherence may occasion reconsideration of Contributor privileges by the Custodian as a matter of best practice.
